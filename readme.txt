The FireStorm Real Estate Plugin is an advanced real estate plugin allowing you to turn your WordPress website or blog into a fully functional real estate listing website. The plugin is ideal for Realtors, Agents, For Sale By Own listings and Real Estate Agencies. The administration is easy to use and loaded with features. It operates stand-alone which means it does not require blog posts for each listing. This allows you to keep your blog separate from the real estate listings.
